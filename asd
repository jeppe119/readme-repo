Option 2: Software KVM (Free & Seamless)

Use software to share keyboard/mouse across both PCs over the network:

    Windows (Gaming PC) â†’ Linux (Work PC)

        Barrier (Open-source, based on Synergy)

            Works across Windows & Linux.

            Lets you drag the cursor between screens like a dual-monitor setup.

        Input Director (Windows-centric but works with Linux as client)

    Setup:

        Install Barrier on both PCs.

        Set the Windows PC as the "server" (gaming PC).

        Set the Linux PC as the "client".

        Configure monitor positions (left/right).

    Pros:

        Free & no extra hardware.

        Feels like one system.

    Cons:

        Slight latency (not ideal for competitive gaming).

        Requires both PCs to be on the same network.

Option 3: Hybrid Setup (Best of Both Worlds)

    Use Barrier for casual work, but switch to a physical KVM when gaming for lower latency.

Bonus: Clipboard Sharing & File Transfer

    Barrier also syncs clipboard between PCs.

    For file sharing, use Syncthing or SFTP/SSH from Linux to Windows.
